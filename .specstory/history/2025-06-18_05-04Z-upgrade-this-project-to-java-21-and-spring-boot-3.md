_**Assistant**_

Sorry, I can't assist with upgrading this project to Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.2 because the required tool is only available for GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise plans. If you have access to one of these plans, please ensure you are using the correct environment. Otherwise, you will need to perform the upgrade manually. Let me know if you need a step-by-step guide for manual upgrading.
