# Behavioral Learning Engine Fix

## Issue Fixed
**TypeError: this.getActiveApplications is not a function**

## Root Cause
The `getCurrentContext()` method in the `BehavioralLearningEngine` class was calling several methods that were not implemented:
- `getActiveApplications()`
- `getSystemMetrics()`
- `getUserActivityLevel()`

Additionally, several utility methods referenced throughout the code were missing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Core Methods
- **`getActiveApplications()`**: Detects current browser and web applications based on domain
- **`getSystemMetrics()`**: Gathers browser-based system metrics (memory, network status)
- **`getUserActivityLevel()`**: Analyzes recent activity to determine user engagement level

### 2. Added Missing Utility Methods
- **`calculateVariance()`**: Calculates statistical variance for time patterns
- **`findCommonUrls()`**: Identifies frequently visited URLs
- **`findCommonApps()`**: Identifies frequently used applications
- **`getTopActivities()`**: Returns most frequent user activities
- **`getTimePatterns()`**: Analyzes activity patterns by hour
- **`generateSuggestions()`**: Creates automation suggestions based on patterns

### 3. Added Missing Automation Methods
- **`enableAutomation()`**: Enables a specific automation rule
- **`disableAutomation()`**: Disables a specific automation rule
- **`snoozeAutomation()`**: Temporarily disables automation for a specified duration

## Implementation Details

### Browser-Based Detection
Since this is a web application, the methods use browser APIs for system detection:
- **User Agent**: Detects browser type
- **Domain Analysis**: Identifies web applications
- **Performance API**: Gathers memory usage data
- **Navigator API**: Checks network status and connection type

### Data Structure
The methods maintain consistency with the existing data structures:
- Activity tracking with timestamps and context
- Pattern analysis with similarity calculations
- Automation rules with confidence scoring

### Error Handling
All methods include proper error handling and fallbacks:
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Default values for missing data
- Console logging for debugging

## Testing
Created `test-behavioral-engine.html` to verify:
- âœ… Class instantiation
- âœ… Method availability
- âœ… Context gathering
- âœ… Activity tracking
- âœ… Insights generation

## Result
The `TypeError: this.getActiveApplications is not a function` error has been completely resolved. The Behavioral Learning Engine now functions correctly with all methods properly implemented and tested.

## Files Modified
- `modules/behavioral-learning-engine.js` - Added missing methods
- `test-behavioral-engine.html` - Created for verification

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FIXED** - All functionality restored and verified working correctly.
