## 📋 Server Configuration

### Required MCP Server Configuration
Ensure your MCP configuration includes these servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/workspace"]
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "time": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-time"]
    },
    "sqlite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/path/to/database.db"]
    },
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Ensure file paths are accessible

**Server connection errors**
- Restart MCP servers
- Verify server configuration
- Check network connectivity

**Performance issues**
- Close unused applications
- Clear browser cache
- Restart MCP server processes

**Data not persisting**
- Check filesystem server permissions
- Verify SQLite database is writable
- Ensure memory server is configured correctly

### Debug Mode
Add `?debug=true` to any application URL to enable debug logging:
```
file:///path/to/test-suite/index.html?debug=true
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Local Execution**: Applications run locally for maximum security
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained with no CDN requirements
- **Server Isolation**: Each MCP server runs in its own process
- **Data Privacy**: All data remains on your local system

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real MCP Integration**: Connect to actual MCP servers (currently simulated)
- **User Authentication**: Multi-user support with role-based access
- **Cloud Deployment**: Docker containers and cloud-ready configurations
- **API Extensions**: REST API for external integrations
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom applications

### Contributing
